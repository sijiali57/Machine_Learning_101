## Part 2 - Machine Learning (ML)
**Concept**
Machine Learning is a cross-over area including Probability, Statistics, Approximation Theory, Convex Analysis etc. It's a subject to use computer to simulate human behaviour to gain learning ability to improve itself performance.

**Area** Machine Learning is a sub-category of Artificial Intelligence.

**Definition** (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. More details can be find [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

* 1951 Arthur Samuel 
 `Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed`

* 1996 Langley
```Machine learning is a science of the artificial. The field's main objects of study are artifacts, specifically algorithms that improve their performance with experience.```

* 1997 Tom Michell
```Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.```

* 2006 Sewell
```Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence concerned with the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. In practice, this involves creating programs that optimize a performance criterion through the analysis of data. ```


**Learning** According to Experience (E) and series of tasks (T) within certain performance (P), if the machine get more E to achieve T with better P then this machine has learning ability.

For example:
AlphaGo, Voice recoginization and Auto-drive
