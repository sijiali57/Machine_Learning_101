## Part 2 - Machine Learning (ML)
**Concept**
Machine Learning is a cross-over area including Possibility, Statistic, Approimation Theroy, Conves Analysis etc subjects. It's a subject to use computer to similate human behavior to gain learning ability to improve itself performance.

**Area** Machine Learning is a sub-category of Artificial Intelligence.

**Definition** (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. More details can be find [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

* 1951 Arthur Samuel 
 `Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed`

* 1996 Langley
* 1997 Tom Michell


**Learning** According to Experience (E) and a series tasks (T) with certain performance (P), if the machine get more E to achieve T with higher P then this machine has learning ability.

For example:
AlphaGo, Voice recoginization and Auto-drive
